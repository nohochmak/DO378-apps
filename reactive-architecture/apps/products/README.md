2023 Nov 30 - Dev Notes
For this project used Quarkus 2.13 (DO378 recommended) version in .m2/settings.xml

But in order get it to work outside of the lab environment had to make a few changes.
1. Changed the Prices image in ContainerFile to use the access.redhat version
2. Ran a Podman build to create new local image "redhattraining/do378-reactive-architecture-prices" in docker/podman registry
3. Created a container instance manually using Podman: 
    podman run --name prices -p 5000:5000  -d redhattraining/do378-reactive-architecture-prices

This was annoying but not terribly complex.

Pushing this back to my GitHub repo to capture changes.

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/products-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.
